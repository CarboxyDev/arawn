## Why Blitzpack?

Most full-stack templates give you a folder structure and routing. Blitzpack gives you a complete, production-ready application with authentication, admin controls, API infrastructure, observability and several more battle-tested features. You get a solid frictionless foundation to build your next product on.

What normally takes 2-3 weeks of infrastructure work is ready in a single command.

- **Truly Production-Ready**: Auth flows, rate limiting, structured logging, testing infrastructure and more are configured for production from day one.

- **Built for Zero Friction**: Unified tooling, shared packages, monorepo structure and full TypeScript support ensures that all components work seamlessly together.
  
- **No Assembly Required**: Auth flows, email system, admin dashboard, and other core features are already wired up and ready to use. No more wasting time setting up from scratch.

- **True full-stack type safety**: Zod schemas validate once, protect everywhere. From API requests to database queries to UI forms.

- **Authentication Made Easy**: Login, Sign-up, Email verification, password reset, OAuth (Google/GitHub), role-based access control, session management, and user banning. All wired up and working. Not TODOs but actual implementations.
  
- **Modern UI out of the box** - You get beautiful components with shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, dark/light mode, theme support and smooth animations.

- **Hassle-Free Database** - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, easy migrations and Docker setup that just works.

- **AI Agent Ready**: The bundled CLAUDE.md documentation gives AI agents instant context about the structure. Ship faster with AI that understands your whole stack.

## Quick Start
